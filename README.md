## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a software engineering student with an emerging passion for data science. After completing an intensive "Introduction to Data Science with Python" course in Poland (4 ECTS), I found myself fascinated by the power of machine learning, deep learning, and the data-driven approach to solving problems. Whether I am a software engineer, a data scientist in training, or both—I see myself as someone eager to learn, experiment, and build meaningful solutions.
